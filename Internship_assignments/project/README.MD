# This project contains only the web-designing part of the WebDev
	  

We have used html to form the structure of the website and we have used 
css to design the website 

this project has been entirely built using the reference of the original amazon website 
code is not copied but I've used the website to form a basic webdesign in the mind to get the desired output at the end.

Key Topics used

: box-shadow - adds shadow to the element using offset-x and offset-y 

: hover effect - changes the color as we hover over the specific element

the code repository structure is formed in such a way
