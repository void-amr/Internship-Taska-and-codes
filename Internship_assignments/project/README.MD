# This project contains only the web-designing part of the WebDev
	  

We have used html to form the structure of the website and we have used 
css to design the website 

https://www.vanessamckeown.com/
	 
this project has been entirely built using the reference of this website 
code is not copied but I've used this website to form a basic webdesign in the mind to get the desired output at the end.


the code repository structure is formed in such a way 

	project 
	 |
	 src (contains the code)
	 | 
	 assets (contains all the resources images and other things) 
	 
	 readme.md
